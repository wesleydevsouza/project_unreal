# 🕹️ Unreal Engine 5.3 Blueprint Study Project

This was my **first project using Unreal Engine 5.3**, focused entirely on learning the **Blueprint visual scripting system**.

The project was developed by following a tutorial provided by **[Pixel Helmet on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PixelHelmet)**, and it helped me understand the basics of gameplay mechanics, level design, and interaction systems in Unreal without writing code.

### Key Learning Highlights:

* Introduction to **Blueprints** for logic and interaction
* Working with **UE5.3 interface** and level editor
* Creating basic character movement and object interaction
* Understanding Unreal's **actor system**, **components**, and **events**

> 🎓 This project is meant purely for learning purposes and doesn't represent a polished or complete game.
